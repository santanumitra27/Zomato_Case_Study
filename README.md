# Zomato_Case_Study
Hi, This is my second SQL Project. I downloaded two files from Kaggle's, sorted the data, and then tried to find a few solutions by asking a few Business Questions. 

/*Business Qurries: 
1) Help Zomato in identifying the cities with poor Restaurant ratings
2) Mr.roy is looking for a restaurant in kolkata which provides online 
delivery. Help him choose the best restaurant
3) Help Peter in finding the best rated Restraunt for Pizza in New Delhi.
4)Enlist most affordable and highly rated restaurants city wise.
5)Help Zomato in identifying the restaurants with poor offline services
6)Help zomato in identifying those cities which have atleast 3 restaurants with ratings >= 4.9
  In case there are two cities with the same result, sort them in alphabetical order.
7) What are the top 5 countries with most restaurants linked with Zomato?
8) What is the average cost for two across all Zomato listed restaurants? 
9) Group the restaurants basis the average cost for two into: 
Luxurious Expensive, Very Expensive, Expensive, High, Medium High, Average. 
Then, find the number of restaurants in each category. 
10) List the two top 5 restaurants with highest rating with maximum votes.
